    #    show the route's path (ie: route identifier), eg: /users/:name, not the actual path.

    # FN_REQUEST_URL - the full URL for the request (parsing example)
    # FN_APP_NAME - the name of the application that matched this route, eg: myapp
    # FN_PATH - the matched route, eg: /hello
    # FN_METHOD - the HTTP method for the request, eg: GET or POST
    # FN_CALL_ID - a unique ID for each function execution.
    # FN_FORMAT - a string representing one of the function formats, currently either default or http. Default is default.
    # FN_MEMORY - a number representing the amount of memory available to the call, in MB
    # FN_TYPE - the type for this call, currently 'sync' or 'async'
    # FN_HEADER_$X - the HTTP headers that were set for this request. Replace $X with the upper cased name of the header and replace dashes in the header with underscores.
    # $X - any configuration values you've set for the Application or the Route. Replace X with the upper cased name of the config variable you set. Ex: minio_secret=secret will be exposed via MINIO_SECRET env var.
